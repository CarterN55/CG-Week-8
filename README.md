I used the hologram shader on both the model and a capsule. The model doesn't work the same as the capsule so it just has the coloured lines cover the whole thing which creates a flickering effect. The capsule can show the lines normally with a weird effect occuring when you look at it from a certain angle (Seen on the bottom of the capsule).

I uesd the Stencil (Read Hole and Front) to make a little "window" that you could see through. There's a cylinder sticking out of the wall to create the circular shape.
